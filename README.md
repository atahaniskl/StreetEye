# StreetEye

This project leverages artificial intelligence to detect damages on asphalt roads and marks the detected areas on a map, providing an interactive visual representation on the same site.

Features:
AI-Powered Damage Detection:
Utilizes a trained machine learning model to identify road damage from input data.
Interactive Mapping:
Detected damages are dynamically marked on a map for easy visualization and tracking.
Web Integration:
Both the detection results and the map are displayed seamlessly on a web platform.
